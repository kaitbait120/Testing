# Authentication

Before you can use one of the SMART APIs, you must first generate an APIÂ key. An API key is a unique code that is sent to an API to identify the calling application or user. The API key acts as an identifier or token for authentication. 

Note: Generating a custom API key is only available for Q2 SMART customers with the Custom Audience API, Traits by User API, or Heuristic Traits API. If your FI is interested in any of the SMART APIs, contact your Q2 Relationship Manager.

**To generate an API key**

1. Select **toggle menu open** > **Toggle API key generator**. 
2. Select **Generate API Key**. 
3. In the **Nickname** field, enter a nickname for the API key. 
4. Select **Generate key**. The key generates in the **API Key** field.
5. Copy the generated key and save it in a secure place. 
  Note: For security purposes, you will not be able to see the API key again once the window closes.
6. Select **Close window**. 

You can now send this API key with requests you make to the SMART APIs. 

Note: If you lose an API key, you can generate a new key.
