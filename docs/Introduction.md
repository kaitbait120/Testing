# Introduction
 
Q2 SMART offers FIs the following four APIs: 

**Heuristic Trait API**—allows you to set trait values for data that Q2 does not access. For example, this data may include users' credit scores. Once created, Q2 receives this trait and adds it to SMART. You can set and update traits as users are added or removed from that trait. 

**Traits by User API**—allows you to pull traits from SMART and add them to other applications like a CRM. You can then match a user in an external system and show the various traits applied to that user in an external application.

**Campaigns by User API**—returns a list of active campaigns that are associated with a specific user.

**Custom Audience API**—allows you to push or pull custom audiences to and from SMART. Currently, SMART allows you to manually upload a custom audience, but this API automates this process.

Note: If your FI is interested in any of the SMART APIs, contact your Q2 Relationship Manager.
